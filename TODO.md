# AI-Driven Agricultural Intelligence Platform - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building a professional AI-powered agricultural price forecasting platform for chilli prices with enterprise-grade UI/UX.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Design System
- [x] 1.1 Review existing project structure and examples
- [x] 1.2 Create design system with color tokens (cyan, purple, green theme)
- [x] 1.3 Set up routing structure for all pages
- [x] 1.4 Install required dependencies (recharts, framer-motion)

### Phase 2: Core Components
- [x] 2.1 Create reusable UI components (GlassCard, MetricCard, AnimatedNumber)
- [x] 2.2 Build chart components (PriceChart, ForecastChart, HeatmapChart)
- [x] 2.3 Create AI-themed loading animations
- [x] 2.4 Build header and navigation components

### Phase 3: Page Implementation
- [x] 3.1 Landing Page
  - [x] Hero section with animations
  - [x] Key metrics display
  - [x] CTA buttons
- [x] 3.2 AI Prediction Dashboard
  - [x] Left sidebar with filters
  - [x] Price prediction card
  - [x] Interactive charts (4+ charts)
  - [x] KPI widgets
- [x] 3.3 AI Insights Engine Page
  - [x] Auto-generated insights
  - [x] Risk alerts
  - [x] Future trend highlights
- [x] 3.4 AI Chat Assistant
  - [x] Chat interface
  - [x] Message history
  - [x] Floating bubble
  - [x] LLM API integration (optional)
- [x] 3.5 Advanced Charts Page
  - [x] AI-annotated graphs
  - [x] Scenario simulation sliders
  - [x] What-if analysis
- [x] 3.6 Model Intelligence Page
  - [x] Model comparison table
  - [x] Feature importance charts
  - [x] Performance metrics

### Phase 4: Data & Logic
- [x] 4.1 Create mock data generators for realistic predictions
- [x] 4.2 Implement prediction logic simulation
- [x] 4.3 Add data filtering and transformation utilities
- [x] 4.4 Create AI insights generation logic

### Phase 5: Animations & Polish
- [x] 5.1 Add Framer Motion animations to all pages
- [x] 5.2 Implement smooth page transitions
- [x] 5.3 Add loading states and skeletons
- [x] 5.4 Polish hover effects and micro-interactions

### Phase 6: Responsive Design
- [x] 6.1 Ensure all pages are responsive (desktop-first)
- [x] 6.2 Test on different screen sizes
- [x] 6.3 Optimize mobile experience

### Phase 7: Final Testing & Validation
- [x] 7.1 Run linting and fix issues
- [x] 7.2 Test all features and interactions
- [x] 7.3 Verify all charts render correctly
- [x] 7.4 Check responsive behavior
- [x] 7.5 Final polish and optimization

## Notes
- Using React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Recharts for data visualization
- Framer Motion for animations
- Mock ML prediction data (no real backend initially)
- Professional AI platform aesthetic (OpenAI/Anthropic style)
- Dark theme with cyan/purple/green accents
